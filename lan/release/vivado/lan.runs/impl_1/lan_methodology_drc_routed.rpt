2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_012 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_012]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks rgmii_rxc and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rgmii_rxc] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_012 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_012]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks rgmii_rxc and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks rgmii_rxc] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 6.413 ns between rgmii_rx_ctl (clocked by rgmii_rxc) and gen_slow_rx.i_rgmii_rx_sdr/IDDR_inst/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -5.249 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 6.422 ns between rgmii_rd[2] (clocked by rgmii_rxc) and gen_slow_rx.i_rgmii_rx_sdr/gen_io[2].IDDR_inst/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -5.204 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#3 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 6.422 ns between rgmii_rd[3] (clocked by rgmii_rxc) and gen_slow_rx.i_rgmii_rx_sdr/gen_io[3].IDDR_inst/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -5.191 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#4 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 6.427 ns between rgmii_rd[0] (clocked by rgmii_rxc) and gen_slow_rx.i_rgmii_rx_sdr/gen_io[0].IDDR_inst/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -5.187 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#5 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 6.427 ns between rgmii_rd[1] (clocked by rgmii_rxc) and gen_slow_rx.i_rgmii_rx_sdr/gen_io[1].IDDR_inst/D (clocked by rgmii_rxc) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -5.183 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of -1.000 ns has been defined on port 'rgmii_rd[0]' relative to clock rgmii_rxc for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
