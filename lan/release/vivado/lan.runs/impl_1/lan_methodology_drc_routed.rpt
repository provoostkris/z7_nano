2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.991 ns between i_rgmii_tx_ddr/gen_io[1].ODDR_inst/C (clocked by clk_eth) and rgmii_td[1] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_eth). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.992 ns between i_rgmii_tx_ddr/i_rgmii_tx_ctl/C (clocked by clk_eth) and rgmii_tx_ctl (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_eth). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.994 ns between i_rgmii_tx_ddr/gen_io[3].ODDR_inst/C (clocked by clk_eth) and rgmii_td[3] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_eth). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.002 ns between i_rgmii_tx_ddr/gen_io[0].ODDR_inst/C (clocked by clk_eth) and rgmii_td[0] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_eth). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.004 ns between i_rgmii_tx_ddr/gen_io[2].ODDR_inst/C (clocked by clk_eth) and rgmii_td[2] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_eth). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on key_tri_i[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_tri_o[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on rgmii_txc relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of VIRTUAL_clk_eth.
Related violations: <none>
