2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_012 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_012] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_012 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_012]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_012 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_012] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_012 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_012]
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of -1.000 ns has been defined on port 'rgmii_rd[0]' relative to clock rgmii_rxc for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_input_delay -clock [get_clocks rgmii_rxc] -clock_fall -min -add_delay -1.000 [get_ports {rgmii_rd[*]}]

Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#2 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of -1.000 ns has been defined on port 'rgmii_rd[1]' relative to clock rgmii_rxc for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#3 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of -1.000 ns has been defined on port 'rgmii_rd[2]' relative to clock rgmii_rxc for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#4 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of -1.000 ns has been defined on port 'rgmii_rd[3]' relative to clock rgmii_rxc for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#5 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of -1.000 ns has been defined on port 'rgmii_rx_ctl' relative to clock rgmii_rxc for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_input_delay -clock [get_clocks rgmii_rxc] -clock_fall -min -add_delay -1.000 [get_ports rgmii_rx_ctl]
