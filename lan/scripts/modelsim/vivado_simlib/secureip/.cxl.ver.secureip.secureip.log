                     kind always defaults to wire. Select 'var' for
                     non-compliant behavior, where the kind always defaults
                     to var. The default is 'relaxed', where only a
                     type that is a 4-state scalar or 4-state single
                     dimension vector type defaults to wire.

  -tbxhvllint[=<fileName>][+ignorepkgs[=[[<lib1>.]<pkg1>]...[,[<libN>.]<pkgN>]]]
                     The -tbxhvllint switch causes the compiler to warn about delays found in the source
                     code that may cause synchronization issues in Veloce TBX.
                     NOTE: If you plan to use vsim's -tbxhvllint switch to extract run time delay
                     ----- information then you must use this switch with the compiler.
                     - The #delay warnings may be captured in the optional file <fileName>.
                     - Additionally, the switch '+ignorepkgs' allows you to suppress #delay warnings from
                       imported packages. The '+ignorepkgs' without any arguments will suppress warnings
                       related to all #delays found in all the imported packages. You may fine tune the
                       message suppression by specifying package names (with optional library names). For
                       example '-tbxhvllint+ignorepkgs=uvm_pkg' will cause messages related to #delays
                       found in any package named 'uvm_pkg' (regardless of the library). Specifying
                       '-tbxhvllint+ignorepkgs=mylib.mypkg' will suppress #delay messages related to
                       imported package 'mypkg' from library 'mylib'.
                     - Multiple '-tbxhvllint' switches are allowed.
  -timescale[=]<timescale>
                     Specify the default timescale for modules not having an
                     explicit timescale. The format of <timescale> is the same
                     as that of the `timescale directive.
                     For example, -timescale "1 ns / 1 ps".
  -override_timescale[=]<timescale>
                     Override the timescale specified in the source code.
  -override_precision
                     Override the precision of timescale specified in the source code.

  -mixedsvvh [b | s | v] [packedstruct]

                        b - treat scalars/vectors in package as bit/bit_vector
                        s - treat scalars/vectors in package as std_logic/std_logic_vector

                     with -cuname). The file <fileName> can be used with vopt command's -f switch.
